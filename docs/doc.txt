    Cloning
        
        Clone project using built-in IDE or
            git clone https://github.com/jdmar3-comp426/a99-fighting-mongooses.git
    
    Dependency installation
        
        Open a git-bash terminal targeting /a99-fighting-mongooses and run
            npm install

        Git-Bash documentation: https://git-scm.com/doc
        
        This command will install necessary npm modules into a node-modules folder.
        
        Next, the following commands will trigger:
            cd ./front-end && npm install
            cd ../webserver && npm install
        
        Of which the first command installs npm into the front-end folder,
        and the second command installs npm into the webserver folder.

        The following dependencies are installed within the a99-fighting-mongooses
        folder upon execution of npm install:
            concurrently: 6.4.0
            cors: 2.8.5

        The following dependencies are installed within the front-end folder
        upon execution of npm install:
            browser-sync: 2.27.7
            bulma: 0.9.3

        The following dependencies are installed within the webserver folder

    Building

        Locally save any changes to the project.

        No commands are needed for building the project.

    Deployment

        Open a git-bash terminal targeting /a99-figthing-mongooses and run
            npm run dev
        
        Git-bash documentation: https://git-scm.com/doc

        This command will trigger the following commands using the concurrently dependency:
            npx nodemon ./webserver/app.js
            npx browser-sync ./front-end/ -sw
        
        Of which the first command triggers nodemon to monitor app.js within the webserver folder,
        and the second command triggers browser-sync to monitor the front-end project folder

        The use of nodemon and browser-sync in concurrence allows for real-time interaction with the
        project. This includes API updates, content display, and user interaction.

        To exit the environment, target the git-bash terminal and press CTRL + C
    
    Publishing

        Ensure all changes are saved.

        Push any changes to a new or existing branch within the github repository.

        Open a pull request on GitHub for the branch. Administrators will review changes and either approve
        or deny changes made within the branch. If approved, changes will merge with main.

Style Guide

    A style guide has not been decided upon as of 2021-12-01.

API Referencing

    All API implementation can be found within the webserver folder.

    The API relies on the following dependencies to function:
        better-sqlite3: 7.4.5
        cookie-parser: 1.4.4
        crypto: 1.0.1
        debug: 2.6.9
        express: 4.16.1
        jsonwebtoken: 8.5.1
        md5: 2.3.0
        morgan: 1.9.1
    
    The API requires the following files to function:
        ./webserver/app.js
        ./webserver/database.js
        ./webserver/routes/index.js
        ./webserver/routes/users.js
        ./webserver/routes/login.js
        ./webserver/routes/results.js
    
    The API requires the following endpoints to function:
        /app/
        /app/users/
        /app/login/
        /app/results/
    
    app.js

        This file implements core API functions:
            Dependency requirements (described above)
            File requirements (described above)
            Router requirements (described above)
            Server port
            Token verification
            User verification
        
        The server port is set to a constant of 5000. Thus, the API uses:
            http://localhost:5000
        by default.

        Token verification is done by the verifyToken function.
        This function takes the user's token and compares it with the global SECRET vairable.
        The function has three possible returns:
            { Code 500. Missing Token. }
            { Code 200. OK. }
            { Code 401. Error message. }
        
        User verification is done by the verifyUser function.
        This function takes a user and verifies the user's token with verfiyToken.
        The function has one return:
            next()
        The function can also send a message and status to the console in the event of
        an error throw.

        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.

    index.js

        This file defines the behavior of the endpoint ./webserver/routes/index/

        get (./webserver/routes/index/)
        The get function renders the home page. 

        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.
    
    login.js

        This file defines the behavior of the endpoint ./webserver/routes/login/

        post (./webserver/routes/login/)
        The post function determines if an attempted login matches a user. The function
        can yield two results:
            Successful login, send token.
            Unsuccessful login, display to user "Incorrect username and/or password"
        
        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.

    results.js

        This file defines the behavior of the endpoint ./webserver/routes/results/

        get (./webserver/routes/results/:userId/)
        The get function obtains results that match a given userId from the resultinfo table in
        database.js.

        post (./webserver/routes/results/add/)
        The post function modifies the resultinfo table. The function can yield two results:
            No result found for matching userId, add new result.
            Result found for matching userId, modify result.
        
        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.
    
    users.js

        This file defines the behavior of the endpoint ./webserver/routes/users/

        There are three functions within this file:
            get
            post
            delete
        
        get (./webserver/routes/users/)
        The get function obtains all user listings.
        
        post (./webserver/routes/users/add/)
        The post function adds a user based on the front-end's registration fields.
        User, pass, and salt variables are added to userinfo. A token is passed to log in the
        user upon registration. The function can yield the following results:
            1 record created: ID (id) (201)
            Account already exists with the given username (409)
        
        delete (./webserver/routes/users/delete/)
        The delete function removes a user from the userinfo table.
        The following message is displayed on the console upon deletion:
            User: (username) deleted
        The delete function works regardless of whether an entry exists within the userinfo table.

        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.

Database

    The database can be found within the webserver folder at the database.js file.

    The database is built using the following dependencies:
        better-sqlite3: 7.4.5

    database.js

        This file implements a database which consists of two SQLite3 tables:
            userinfo
            resultinfo
        
        The userinfo table consists of entries containing four (4) variables
            id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
            user    TEXT UNIQUE
            pass    TEXT
            salt    TEXT
        
        The resultinfo table consists of entries containing three (3) variables:
            resultId    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
            result      TEXT
            userId      INTEGER references userinfo(id)
        
        The remainder of the file initializes the database tables using prepare, get, and exec
        commands.

        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.

    user.db

        The user.db file stores database information.

        The user.db file is not accessible by developers or users.
