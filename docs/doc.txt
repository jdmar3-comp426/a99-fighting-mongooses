        No commands are needed for building the project.

    Deployment

        Open a git-bash terminal targeting /a99-figthing-mongooses and run
            npm run dev
        
        Git-bash documentation: https://git-scm.com/doc

        This command will trigger the following commands using the concurrently dependency:
            npm --prefix ./webserver start
            npm --prefix ./front-end start
            
        These commands will trigger the following commands to be run:
        npx browser-sync -sw
        nodemon app.js
        
        Of which the first command triggers nodemon to monitor app.js within the webserver folder,
        and the second command triggers browser-sync to monitor the front-end project folder

Style Guide

    A style guide has not been decided upon as of 2021-12-01.

API Referencing

    All API implementation can be found within the webserver folder.

    The API relies on the following dependencies to function:
        better-sqlite3: 7.4.5
        cookie-parser: 1.4.4
        crypto: 1.0.1
        debug: 2.6.9
        express: 4.16.1
        jsonwebtoken: 8.5.1
        md5: 2.3.0
        morgan: 1.9.1
    
    The API requires the following files to function:
        ./webserver/app.js
        ./webserver/database.js
        ./webserver/routes/index.js
        ./webserver/routes/users.js
        ./webserver/routes/login.js
        ./webserver/routes/results.js
    
    The API requires the following endpoints to function:
        /app/
        /app/users/
        /app/login/
        /app/results/
    
    app.js

        This file implements core API functions:
            Dependency requirements (described above)
            File requirements (described above)
            Router requirements (described above)
            Server port
            Token verification
            User verification
        
        The server port is set to a constant of 5000. Thus, the API uses:
            http://localhost:5000
        by default.

        Token verification is done by the verifyToken function.
        This function takes the user's token and compares it with the global SECRET vairable.
        The function has three possible returns:
            { Code 200. OK. }
            { Code 401. Error message. }
        
        User verification is done by the verifyUser function.
        This function takes a user and verifies the user's token with verfiyToken.
        The function has one return:
            next()
        The function can also send a message and status to the console in the event of
        an error throw.

        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.

    index.js

        This file defines the behavior of the endpoint ./webserver/routes/index/

        get (./webserver/routes/index/)
        The get function renders the home page. 

        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.
    
    login.js

        This file defines the behavior of the endpoint ./webserver/routes/login/

        post (./webserver/routes/login/)
        The post function determines if an attempted login matches a user. The function
        can yield two results:
            Successful login, send token.
            Unsuccessful login, display to user "Incorrect username and/or password"
        
        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.

    results.js

        This file defines the behavior of the endpoint ./webserver/routes/results/

        get (./webserver/routes/results/:userId/)
        The get function obtains results that match a given userId from the resultinfo table in
        database.js.

        post (./webserver/routes/results/add/)
        The post function modifies the resultinfo table. The function can yield two results:
            No result found for matching userId, add new result.
            Result found for matching userId, modify result.
        
        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.
    
    users.js

        This file defines the behavior of the endpoint ./webserver/routes/users/

        There are three functions within this file:
            get
            post
            delete
        
        get (./webserver/routes/users/)
        The get function obtains all user listings.
        
        post (./webserver/routes/users/add/)
        The post function adds a user based on the front-end's registration fields.
        User, pass, and salt variables are added to userinfo. A token is passed to log in the
        user upon registration. The function can yield the following results:
            1 record created: ID (id) (201)
            Account already exists with the given username (409)
        
        delete (./webserver/routes/users/delete/)
        The delete function removes a user from the userinfo table.
        The following message is displayed on the console upon deletion:
            User: (username) deleted
        The delete function works regardless of whether an entry exists within the userinfo table.

        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.

Database

    The database can be found within the webserver folder at the database.js file.

    The database is built using the following dependencies:
        better-sqlite3: 7.4.5

    database.js

        This file implements a database which consists of two SQLite3 tables:
            userinfo
            resultinfo
        
        The userinfo table consists of entries containing four (4) variables
            id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
            user    TEXT UNIQUE
            pass    TEXT
            salt    TEXT
        
        The resultinfo table consists of entries containing three (3) variables:
            resultId    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
            result      TEXT
            userId      INTEGER references userinfo(id)
        
        The remainder of the file initializes the database tables using prepare, get, and exec
        commands.

        The file is exported as a module to use elsewhere.

    user.db

        The user.db file stores database information.

        The user.db file is not accessible by developers or users.

Front-end

    The project's front-end uses HTML for content and CSS for styling. All front-end code can be found in 
    the a99-fighting-mongooses/front-end folder.

    HTML content

        The project uses a one-page design. All website HTML resides in index.hmtl.

        Content is organized with basic HTML:
            div
            form
            etc.
        
        Content is written using appopriate HTML:
            image
            h1 - h5
            etc.
        
        HTML documentation is provided by Mozilla here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

    CSS

        The project uses Bulma as a stylesheet to assist in webpage design and organization. Bulma, as with other
        spreadsheets, uses custom HTML class names to quickly style content.

        Bulma documentation can be found here: https://bulma.io/documentation/

        Custom CSS can be found in custom_style.css. The file consists of basic CSS to style the background
        and to modify content organization.

    JavaScript

        JavaScript interacts with website elements to display specific content based on user input.

        All front-end JavaScript can be found in the logic.js file.

        returnDescription

            This function uses a switch statement based on a result variable to return a pre-defined description.

            The following returns are possible:
                CASE: "Lion"    RETURN: "Your inner Lion is a ferocious creature. You are proud..."
                CASE: "Serpent" RETURN: "Your inner Serpent is very meticulous. You are very clever..."
                CASE: "Eagle"   RETURN: "Your inner Eagle is always curious. You are eager..."
                CASE: "Badger"  RETURN: "Your inner Badger is clear cut. You are quick..."
                CASE: default   RETURN: null    LOG: "returnDescription: No result given"
        
        saveUserResults

            This function uses a results variable to save a user's credentials and show the dashboard.

            If a result returns a fetch status of 200, the dashboard is shown. Otherwise, an error is thrown.
        
        loadUsersResults

            loadUsersResults uses a result variable to load content to the user's dashboard.

            If a function returns a fetch status of 200, the following occurs:
                Update HTML result title
                Update HTML result display
                Update HTML result script
            
            Otherwise, the folliwng message is logged:
                "Error: [error message]"
            
        registrationForm.addEventListener

            This function displays content based on a user's input to the registration form.

            If the registration form is filled out correctly (status 200):
                The user will be logged in
                The dashboard will be shown

            If the registration form is filled out incorrectly (status 409):
                The user will be informed that the username is taken
            
            If there is an error:
                LOG: "Error: [error message]"
        
        loginForm.addEventListener

                The user will be informed that their password is incorrect
            
        regusername.addEventListener + regPassword.addEventListener + regConfirmPassword.addEventListener

            These functions authenticate that the username and password fields are arbitrarily valid.

            The following conditions define a valid username:
                Username has more than 5 characters
            
            The following conditions define a valid password:
                Password is more than 6 characters
                Password is the same as the input in the "Confirm Password" field.
        
        deleteButton.addEventListener

            This function handles the "delete account" button.

            The following occurs upon a click:
                The user is logged out
            
            If an error occurs:
